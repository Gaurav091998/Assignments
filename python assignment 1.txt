# Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?## 
# Ans."Because they are not written in machine-readable language, 
#      Python programs need to be processed before machines can run them. 
#      Python is an interpreted language. This means that every time a program is run, 
#      its interpreter runs through the code and translates it into machine-readable byte code."

# Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
# Ans. " Dynamic typing means that the type of the variable is determined only during runtime."

# Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
# Ans. "pros:It's Simple, It's Free, It's Easy to Use, It's Highly Compatible, It is Object-Oriented."
#      "cons:Poor memory efficiency, Slow speed, Runtime Errors."

# Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
# Ans. "artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning, web development, gaming, gui, etc"

# Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
# Ans. "Variables are the labels of specific memory location and it's like containers in our kitchen."
#      "start declare by alphabet and underscore only."

# Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
# Ans . "with the help of input() inbuilt function therefor eg: user_variable = input("Enter the value:")"

# Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
# Ans. "The default value that has been taken as an input() is string "

# Q8. What is type casting?
# Ans. " There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. Then we use type casting."

# Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
# Ans. "No, it's give an error. One input function can hold only one value"

#  Q10. What are keywords?
#  Ans. "Keywords are some predefined and reserved words in python that have special meanings.
#        Keywords are used to define the syntax of the coding."

#  Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
#  Ans. "No, Keywords are used to define the syntax of the coding.
#        The keyword cannot be used as an identifier, function, and variable name. "

#  Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
#  Ans. "Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
#        Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only,
#        the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code."

# Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
# Ans. "with the help of print() inbuilt function."

#  Q14. What are operators in Python?
#  Ans. "Operators are the special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed. 
#        and there are seven different types of operators: arithmetic operators, assignment operators,
#        comparison operators, logical operators, identity operators, membership operators, and boolean operators."

# Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
# Ans. "/ gives full value with decimals but // only give whole value or cieling value without decimals."

# Q-17
# take a number from user
usr_inp = int(input("Enter a Number:"))
if usr_inp % 2 == 0:
    print("It is an Even Number")
else:
    print("It is an Odd Number")

Enter a Number:34
It is an Even Number

# Q18. What are boolean operator?
# Ans. "AND , OR , NOT or ANDNOT are the boolean operator."

# Q19. What will the output of the following?
# 1 or 0 -- Ans. 1

# 0 and 0 -- Ans. 0

#True and False and True -- Ans. False

#1 or 0 or 0 -- Ans. 1

# Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
# Ans. "if, if-else, elif, nested if, and nested if-else are the conditional statements."

# Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
# Ans. "it is elif conditional statment where it check all type of possibilities write by user."

# Q-22

if usr_age >= 18:
    print("I can vote")
else:
    print("I can't vote")
